### My first 2D plataform. This is a project from a [Dunki Code][1] course. It's a begginer course that i took after finish the [Unity learn pathway][2], so i implemented some features way further the original intented. Every line of code was improved as well as gameplay and UI.
Currently not avaliable on mobile. I'm working on it ðŸ˜Š.  
  
## Gameplay
  
  As a plataform 2D the mechanics are simple: You move left and right, jump, attack and roll. With Unity's new input system you can play on keyboard and mouse or a controller. You can get the controls scheme on the main menu and on pause menu.

## Enemies
    
  There are 3 types of enemies: Slime, Bat and Blob. They share an abstract class, so they all behave more or less the same way. But they differ in health and movement.
    
## UI
    
  The player and each enemy has a health bar. The pause button and menu options are simple, but works great with well design game state code.
